Integrate skylight calendar into home assistant

NOTE - I only own one Skylight frame. In theory this integration should work with multiple, I havent tested it.

# Install

1) Put these files into the `custom_components/skylight_calendar` folder in home assistant.
2) Restart Home assistant. 
3) setup skylight calendar in devices and services.

# Setup

1) Add `Skylight Calendar` in devices and services
2) Log into Skylight with your credentials
